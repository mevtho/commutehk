# COMMUTE HK

## Genesis

A quick project to handle a smoother commute through HK transportation system. Hard-coded to a specific route
but can easily be adapted to another.

## Improvements

According to the needs, it may be required to add support for KMB, Star Ferry, ... Not done yet as no need for it.

Designed to be working on mobile, some work may be required for nicer experience on larger devices

Code doesn't use composer / autoloading / ... none of the fancy stuff and could be improved quite a bit in a lot of various aspects.
Being mainly meant as a quick fun project for a specific need, spending more time isn't necessarily justified.
